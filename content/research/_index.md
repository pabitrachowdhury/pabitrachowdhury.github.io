## Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of health, labor, and public economics. I focus on questions of competition, vertical integration, long-term care, aging, and workforce issues in healthcare, which touches IO and healthcare more substantially. I also have interests in studying economics of AI. I primarily employ causal inference methods to address these questions.
